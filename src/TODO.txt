TODO 7/8/23:

+++ BACKLOG:

14) OPTIMIZE: parallel tasks so we can export multiple lists at a time

16) TODO_EXCLUDECOMPLETED: All Commands - Option: exclude completed

18) Export File Names: use task.title
- CURRENT: using task.id in filename
- REQ: use task.title
- ISSUE: there may be multiple tasks with the same title, and we need a deterministic way to disambiguate.

19) EXE: rename to MSTTool

21) Recovery Detect: when a __Deleted task is recovered, move it to __Recovered
- REF: HandleRemainingItems
- TD: need to always load the __Deleted and __Recovered files

+++ REQUIRES WRITE SUPPORT:

15) purge command: (Writes to API) cleanup old "complete" tasks according to some safe criteria. 
- E.g. repeating tasks, oldest except last "X"
- by default preview mode
- option to commit

22) Undelete Specific Task: useful for when we detect a Task has been erroneously deleted


+++ REGRESS:

20) Cross-Platform: test if still works on other platforms

P2:
13) diff command: compare two export folders 


+++ OPTIONAL:

6.3) Lists: cache mapping from displayName to Id so don't have to retrieve each time [TODO_LISTARGUMENT]
