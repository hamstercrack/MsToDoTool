TODO 4/3/23:

6.3) Lists: cache mapping from displayName to Id so don't have to retrieve each time [TODO_LISTARGUMENT]

14) OPTIMIZE: parallel tasks so we can export multiple lists at a time

15) purge command: (Writes to API) cleanup old "complete" tasks according to some safe criteria. 
- E.g. repeating tasks, oldest except last "X"
- by default preview mode
- option to commit

16) TODO_EXCLUDECOMPLETED: All Commands - Option: exclude completed

18) Export File Names: use task.title
- CURRENT: using task.id in filename
- REQ: use task.title
- ISSUE: there may be multiple tasks with the same title, and we need a deterministic way to disambiguate.

19) EXE: rename to MSTTool

REGRESS:
19) Cross-Platform: test if still works on other platforms

P2:
13) diff command: compare two export folders
